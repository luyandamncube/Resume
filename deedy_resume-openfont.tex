%     PERSONAL SUMMARY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Personal Summary}

Inquisitive, hard-working and creative at heart. People come first in my life and I am not afraid of a challenge or shouldering responsibility. I love to learn and find myself sharing everything I learn about technology with the people around me. 
\sectionsep

I currently work as a Data Engineer at Britehouse and have previously worked as an intern in their Graduate Program for 2019. At the moment, I am currently interested in data and automation, having spent a lot of my personal time doing projects in data preparation, regression models, RPA and infrastructure provisioning.
\sectionsep

I studied Software engineering at Wethinkcode (a school based on  42: tuition-free computer programming school created and funded by French billionaire Xavier Niel and partners) and I am currently studying Computer Science \& Mathematics part-time. All my work and project can be viewed on my personal github.
